// This is the theme that defines how your app renders.
//
// Your app is given its own theme so it is easier and less
// messy for you to override specific things just for your
// app.
//
// You don't have to create the whole theme on your own, though:
// your app's theme is based on SproutCore's Ace theme.
//
// NOTE: if you want to change the theme this one is based on, don't
// forget to change the :css_theme property in your buildfile.
